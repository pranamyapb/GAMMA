Astronomical mosaics are often created by stitching multiple telescope sub-frames to cover large fields of view. During the stitching process, there are various factors like detector bias, gain variation, and illumination gradients that cause these sub- frames to exhibit non-uniform background intensity, and that leads to visible seams that compromise scientific detailing and aesthetic quality. In this paper, we present GAMMA, a Grid-wise Adaptive Mean Matching Algorithm, that automatically balances intensity across stitched astronomical grids while preserving point-source (stellar) brightness. This project explores a proposed classical computer vision approach that divides the image into data-driven regions using gradient-based segmentation. It com- putes background intensity statistics per segment, and performs adaptive background equalization relative to a global target mean. Experimental results on stitched astronomical mosaics demonstrate that GAMMA reduces background disparity and enhances visual uniformity without degrading photometric fea- tures such as stars and galaxies.
